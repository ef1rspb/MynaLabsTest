**Filters for Voices**    

📱**Task description**   
Your task is to apply voice filters to a recorded video, similar to Tik-Tok and Snapchat. Let your creativity thrive when coming up with these voice filters.    

The app should consist of two screens, or more, the world is your oyster:   
●	Home screen where the user can record video or select video from the gallery.   
●	A screen where the target filter is selected. Once, the filter is chosen by the user, the app replaces the initial audio with a new one. You should also add a Share button here, which makes it easy to post the generated content on social networks.
